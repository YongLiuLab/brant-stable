Help information for Coregister:

Subject info:
    reference: Filetype of reference image stored in each subject's folder to register.
    source: Filetype of image to match the reference image stored in each subject's folder.
    seg&bet: Segment structural T1/T2 and skull stripe, use skull striped T1/T2 to coregister which is better sometimes and unsupervised. The dis-advantage is taking few minutes more time for each subject.
        options:
            1:segment using new segment and bet based on tissue probability maps;
            2:bet only (there should be segmented c1-c3*.nii files in the directory);
            other number:do not segment nor bet; we recommend using co*.nii instead of bet*.nii to normalise.
Estimate: 
    object fun: Methods to maximise or minimise objective function.
    sep: The average distance between sampled points (in mm).
    tol: The accuacy for each paramters.
    fwhm: Kernel of gaussian smooth to apply to the 256*256 joint histogram.
    
Write:
    interp: Interpolation methods for write option. (0 for Nearest Neighbor; 1 for Trilinear; 2-7 for 2nd-7th Degree B-Spline; Inf for Fourier Interpolation).
    wrap: 3 dimensions of wrapping, e.g. [1 1 1] for wrapping in X, Y and Z direction, [0 0 0] for no wrapping.
    mask: Mask images.
    prefix: Output source images will have a prefix of 'r' by default.
