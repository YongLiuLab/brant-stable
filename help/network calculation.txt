Help information for Network Calculation:

parallel workers: number of workers used for parallel computing.
filetype: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
data dir: directory where all *.txt correlation matrix results are stored.

matrix type:
    raw value: use raw value to construct binary matrix.
    absolute value: use absolute value to construct binary matrix.
	
thresholds of correlation coefficient: a vector of correlation threshold, for each element, threshold the input matrix¡¯s intensity to a binary network.
correlation thres: vector of thresholds for correlation.

thresholds of sparsity: a vector of sparsity threshold, for each element, threshold the input matrix using the fraction of the matrix¡¯s largest number of connection n * (n+1)/2;
correlation thres: vector of thresholds for sparsity.

minimum spanning tree: a process to avoid unconnected network.

Network properies: a panel to select network properties.
out dir: output directory for saving results.
