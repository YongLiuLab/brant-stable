Denoise
	================================
	Detrend:
	    demean: regress out intercept for each voxel's temporal series.
	    detrend: regress out linear drifts for each voxel's temporal series.
	    
	Tissue Regressors:
	Selected masks in standard space will be used to extract mean signal within the mask, the mean temporal signal will futher be used as regressors.
	    global signal mask: mask for extracting global mean signal.
	    white matter mask: mask for extracting white matter mean signal.
	    CSF mask: mask for extracting ventricle mean signal.
	    user defined mask: mask for extracting user defined mean signal.
	    
	Headmotion Model:
	    R: six headmotion parameters generated from Realign, invols translation and rotation [pitch roll yaw].
	    R': temporal derivatives of six headmotion parameters, the first volume's derivatives will be replaced by zeros.
	    R^2: square of six headmotion parameters.
	    R_{t-1}: previous headmotion parameters.
	    scrub&regress (FD): generated a temporal mask using framwise displacement calculated from R, and do a regression without using 'bad' timepoints.
	    filetype (R): normally be a rp*.txt file generated by Realign with 6 columns of headmotion parameters.
