Network Visualization
	================================
	surface: surface file
	alpha: degree of transparency
	display: mode of display
	node: node file defined as excel table or txt. When input using txt file, ten columns of input should be in the order of 'x', 'y', 'z', 'size', 'module', 'r', 'g', 'b', 'label', when using xls/xlsx file, a office-like software is required for the operation system, ten columns could be in any order but with the first row descriping which column it is (The first column can be written as x, y);
	show node labels: check to show labels defined in input node file.
	same size: use same size for all node, uncheck to use user defined size in input node file.
	user defined node color: use color defined in input node file.
	same node color: use same color for all node.
	module color: use different color for each module. Modules are defined in input node file.
	edge: edge matrix for input file, the number of rows and columns should be the same as input file.
	thickness: relative thickness for all edges
	adjust edge color: use different color for positive and negative edge.
	threshold: an expression that compatible with matlab syntax to filter out unwanted edges in edge matrix.
