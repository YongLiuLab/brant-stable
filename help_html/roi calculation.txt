ROI Calculation
	================================
	roi file: ROIs in one nifti file
	roi info: labels of tagged ROIs in an .txt file. (optional)
	E.g. 
	1 SFG
	2 MFG
	3 IFG
	brain mask: mask for the data
	name position: subject identifier for input data
	input filetype: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
	4D nifti files: if the input data is 4D, check this item. Otherwise uncheck.
	input dirs: directories can be input either using a .txt file or spm select window.
	extract mean: extract mean time series for each ROI
	roi to roi correlation: calculate correlation between pairs of ROI
	roi to whole brain correlation: calculate correlation between each ROI’s mean time series and voxels in the mask.
	Pearson’s correlation: correlation type
	Partial correlation: when calculating correlation, between one roi mean time series and voxels/other time series, the rest of roi mean time serieses will be regressed out from the calculation.
	output path: an output directory for saving results.
